# Java Programming Projects â€“ Codsoft Internship

This repository contains three Java programs developed as part of my **Programming in Java internship** at **Codsoft**. The internship involved creating small-scale programs to strengthen my understanding of **Java fundamentals, OOP concepts, and problem-solving skills**.  

## Projects

### 1. ATM Simulation
- **Description:** Simulates a simple ATM interface where users can deposit, withdraw, and check their account balance.
- **Key Concepts:** Classes, objects, methods, user input, control statements.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
- **Description:** A console-based number guessing game with three difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard). The player guesses a random number, and the game provides hints until the correct number is guessed.
- **Key Concepts:** Loops, conditional statements, random number generation, methods.

### 3. Student Grades Calculator
- **Description:** Calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade for a student based on marks entered for multiple subjects.
- **Key Concepts:** Arrays, loops, conditionals, basic arithmetic operations.

## Skills Learned
- Core Java programming (OOP, data types, control structures)
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Handling user input with `Scanner`
- Working with arrays and methods
- Basic console-based application design

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
